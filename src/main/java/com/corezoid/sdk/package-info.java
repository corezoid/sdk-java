/**
 * Corezoid SDK for Java.
 * <p>
 * This package provides a Java client for the Corezoid Process Engine platform.
 * It allows developers to create, modify, and manage tasks within Corezoid processes
 * (also called conveyors) through a simple and intuitive API.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The SDK handles complex aspects like secure communication, message signing,
 * HTTP connection management, and request/response formatting, allowing developers
 * to focus on their business logic rather than dealing with the low-level details
 * of the Corezoid API.
 * </p>

 * @since 2.0
